This is the first real post for the blog.

So far this blog has been constructed with:  
- **Next.js** 
- **React**
- **Typescript**
- **Tailwind CSS** 
- and hopefully more to come

- Currently the way that the blog posts are read and displayed are from markdown files, and the content
can only be displayed in a basic format. I need to improve on this once the main page is completed.

- I also need to work out a better way to write posts. From initial research, making a Content Management System, something like Microsoft Word's text editor can make these more easily editable and will make the typing experience more pleasant.
