This is the first real post for the blog! I'm working on this website in order to learn about web development technologies and just so I can have a place to show off future projects.
This site started off from the tutorial provided within [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) and I've gradually been building upon it to the state it is in now.

## Stack 

So far this blog has been constructed with:  
- **Next.js** 
- **React**
- **Typescript**
- **Tailwind CSS** 
- and hopefully more to come

Currently the way that the blog posts are read and displayed are from [MDX files](https://mdxjs.com/). Originally they were implemented using regular markdown files however MDX differs to markdown in the way that JSX elements imported and embedded alongside your content.

I also need to work out a better way to write posts. I was thinking of creating an admin dashboard with a WYSIWYG editor to make posts more easily editable and make the typing experience more pleasant.  

Another thing I want to implement is storing these blog posts in a database. The current implementation involves storing posts within a local folder which means to add any new posts I would need to add a new file, create a merge request and redeploy the entire site.
